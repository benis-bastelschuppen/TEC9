<hr /><a name="tetris"></a><h2>Tetris #2</h2>In the last issue I made a <a href="https://benis-bastelschuppen.github.io/TEC9/issues/tec9_03_2023_08_09.html#tetris">Tetris variant</a> in Javascript.
I want to incorporate AI so Tetris can play itself. For that, 
I ported it to Python and made an AI class where all the AI
stuff should happen. Tetris runs in its own class and the AI
can only "see" what the player sees. Tetris is fully playable
right now but the AI is not installed yet. Maybe you can do it?
I prepared it until I did not know how to continue.

You can find it <a href="https://github.com/benis-bastelschuppen/TetrAI" target="_parent">here.

<hr /><a name="sh"></a><h2>Protective Shielding</h2>Have you ever found yourself in a demonstration where the cops
were shooting rubber bullets at people? Were you also envious of
their shields? Here's a simple way to make your own shield.

++ Get a satellite dish that's roughly half your size.
++ Unscrew the receiver.
++ There should be several threads coming out of the satellite
   dish, and you should have the appropriate nuts for them.
++ Drill holes on a small board at the locations of the screws.
++ Attach two belts or similar items to the board using a strong
   stapler, so that you can secure it to your arm.
++ Screw the board onto the satellite dish.

Your shield is ready; attach it to your arm.
When you kneel down, you should be able to completely hide
behind the shield. Also your hand is free.
<hr />
That's it for now.
