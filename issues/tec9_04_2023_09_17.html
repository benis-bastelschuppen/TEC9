<hr /><a name="tetris"></a><h2>Tetris #2</h2>In the last issue I made a <a href="https://benis-bastelschuppen.github.io/TEC9/issues/tec9_03_2023_08_09.html#tetris">Tetris variant</a> in Javascript.
I want to incorporate AI so Tetris can play itself. For that, 
I ported it to Python and made an AI class where all the AI
stuff should happen. Tetris runs in its own class and the AI
can only "see" what the player sees. Tetris is fully playable
right now but the AI is not installed yet. Maybe you can do it?
I prepared it until I did not know how to continue.

You can find it <a href="https://github.com/benis-bastelschuppen/TetrAI" target="_parent">here.

<hr /><a name="sh"></a><h2>Protective Shielding</h2>Have you ever found yourself in a demonstration where the cops
were shooting rubber bullets at people? Were you also envious of
their shields? Here's a simple way to make your own shield.

++ Get a satellite dish that's roughly half your size.
++ Unscrew the receiver.
++ There should be several threads coming out of the satellite
   dish, and you should have the appropriate nuts for them.
++ Drill holes on a small board at the locations of the screws.
++ Attach two belts or similar items to the board using a strong
   stapler, so that you can secure it to your arm.
++ Screw the board onto the satellite dish.

Your shield is ready; attach it to your arm.
When you kneel down, you should be able to completely hide
behind the shield. Also your hand is free.
<hr /><a name="ind"></a><h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>Not the fourth, but the revolution of industry itself.
I've noticed that most products nowadays are manufactured 
from resources that can only be extracted or produced on a
"large scale" with heavy industry.

For example, computer chips require rare earth elements.
Many things are made from plastic, which needs to be
painstakingly produced. Hardly anything is made from metal,
wood, or similar easily obtainable resources. Many things 
can only be manufactured with intricate machines and
production processes.

That's the trick - or the revolution - of the industry.

It has made us dependent on its resources. We should once
again rely more on traditional metals, wood, hemp, and 
other sustainable resources, and only produce the essentials
using "industrial resources."

As industrial resources, I see the following, without
listing everything: Rare earth elements, difficult-to-produce
substances and gases, diamonds (for lasers, etc.), petroleum,
certain metals like platinum, titanium, and others, specific
products like computer chips that can only be manufactured
using industrial machines.

Of course, nowadays there is a need for things like computer
chips that can only be produced industrially. However, one could,
for instance, revert to building circuit boards that operate with
replaceable modules. Due to spatial constraints, today we have to
discard the entire circuit board if a small diode burns out.
In the past, this diode could still be removed and replaced.

Furthermore, we could rely less on chips as controllers if the
function could be achieved with a simple electronic circuit.

These are just examples related to computer chips.

Think about the cars nowadays...
<hr />
That's it for now. I think I stop this now. It's just blabber...
